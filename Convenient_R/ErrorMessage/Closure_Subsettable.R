# object of type 'closure' is not subsettable
# There's an attempt to access a part of an object using $ on something that isn't actually a list or data frame but is instead a function (or "closure" in R's terminology). 
# This kind of error often occurs when variable names conflict with function names, or when expected objects aren't created as anticipated, often due to issues in prior steps of the code or script setup.
